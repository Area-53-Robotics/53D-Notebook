August makes up majority of the early season, right before school starts and all of the team members start to get busy. This means we must plan accordingly, considering that we need to get the structure/core of the design done by the end of this month. We kept in mind a lot of factors, including what the team believed needed to be organized better than it was organized last season. Through these considerations we create the gantt chart below.
