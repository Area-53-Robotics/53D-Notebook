Now that we had identified what our new overall robot design would look like, our next step was to plan the implementation of the overall robot plan. First, we created a tree diagram to represent the breakdown of the parts of the overall robot idea we will need to construct.

= Work Breakdown Structure

= Gantt Chart
Our work breakdown structure for the new overall robot plan is very similar to the tasks we had already put into our High Stakes season gantt chart, which we made in our #entry-reference(type: "management", title: "High Stakes Season Planning"). Therefore, we will use that gantt chart as the basis for our timeline once again. The idea is that every rebuild shall take the same amount of planning and time to construct, therefore a fresh gantt chart. We will follow a similar timeline like the gantt chart from before, and the work breakdown strucuture will provide the thorough approach. We will only elaborate the use of gantt charts when we get to the specifics of the subsystems of the design.
