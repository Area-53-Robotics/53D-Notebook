= Overall
53D had a great season during High Stakes, managing to make it to the States championship and winning design awards along the way. The team has gained a wealth of knowledge about building strategies and how to assess build quality, which will be invaluable for the upcoming season.

#h(1em) I think the High Stakes Season went really well both as a team and individually. As a team I would say we grew a lot from the previous season. We worked better together and were no longer lagging behind the other teams. We were regarded as serious competition in every tournament we went to and significantly improved. 

#h(1em) I think there were definitely some issues with our team’s time management regarding the time for both autonomous and building. We also had issues with our build that we should look out for next year. Individually I think I learned a lot about the role of team lead especially since in the next season those are the shoes I will be filling in.  


=  Eric
#h(1em) 	Looking back at this season, I believe I learned a lot about CAD and the engineering design process that goes along with the construction of our robots. We had some issues due to oversights during designing and next year I plan to learn from these mistakes for a better robot

= Rory
#h(1em) 	Looking back on High Stakes, we could have done worse. We discovered a lot of important things about building, both physically and mentally. We didn’t make it to worlds, although we all felt like we were close, so I think we have a good chance this year.


= Makhi
#h(1em)	The High Stakes season was interesting. We built a robot after a lot of trial and error, and it worked well. Although there were some unpredictable moments where the team just decided to “zip tie it and hope for the best.” We spent more time fixing things than we expected but by States we had a robot capable of many of the things we wanted. 

#h(1em)Our teamwork could be better, as long as the team relies more on me as the driver next season. I do think we had our moments, and were much better as a team than the previous season. I’m sure with my driving skills and the rest of the team we’ll make it to Worlds next season. 


= Anders
#h(1em) Looking back on my first ever season of Vex Robotics, I have to say that I am very glad that I had the opportunity to join this team. Throughout the past school year, I have learned many new things, ranging from safely using power tools to building things with online CAD programs. 

#h(1em) Joining the Area 53 robotics team has also let me make countless new friends, who have been instrumental in teaching me the things I know today. I can't wait to see what the 2025-2026 season will have in store, but I'm sure that it will be just as exciting and enriching as the last one was.
