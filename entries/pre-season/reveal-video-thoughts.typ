Today marks the beginning of the VRC Push Back season. 53D had an online watch party to celebrate, after which we discussed our immediate thoughts. The thoughts below are the general thoughts we had after watching, while we plan to do our in-depth analysis of the game rules at our next meeting.

= Ishika
After watching the game reveal there are a lot of interesting things that pop up during the first watch. The game has a game piece with a very unique shape, it is neither circular nor square but rather multi-dimensional. It is a very interesting shape to incorporate into our future robot designs. I also see that the game is high-scoring having an end game that is not climbing but rather parking making it much easier for even low-level robots. The no-possession limit rule is very helpful in this game due to the huge amount of game elements. The strategy and engineering aspect of this game will be very interesting this year and we must keep looking carefully at the changing metas to develop.

After watching the game reveal there are a number of interesting things about this season. The game has a number of heights for scoring, along with secondary ways to score points, this provides space for multiple prevalent strategies that all work well. It also seems that speed and extension mechanisms will be important this year for the ability to score and descore quickly.

After watching the game reveal for Push Back, I realized that this game is slightly more complicated than other VEX seasons that I’ve been a part of, in terms of scoring. There are goals at three different heights, making for a more complex scoring mechanism. Parking is also new to me, as I have only seen climbing at the end of matches. Parking seems like a fairly straightforward concept, but as always, something will always find a way to break. On top of that, the Push Back game manual hasn’t been released as of yet, so there could always be more rules to make things more difficult. In terms of possession limits, there are no possession limits. This allows for your robot to hold as many of the new blocks as you would like, as long as the robot can stay within the maximum size limit to hold them. This allows for a strategy used in the Over Under season known as ‘Field Starvation.’ Field Starvation is used to take nearly all of the game pieces on the field and hoard them, while not introducing any new blocks on the field. This was a widely disliked strategy due to its nature to make matches boring and one-sided.

After watching the game reveal for Vex PushBack 2025-2026 season, I’ve seen quite a few unique aspects. The blocks aren’t regular 3D polygons or completely spherical, but instead an unique shape. The game also offers many different ways to score, in different areas, which might take time to score. The center control in the goals might also mean a lot of scoring and descoring throughout the game, which also means the robots have to be fast and efficient. There is also no limit to the number of blocks which could mean that teams can hoard blocks until the near end of the game. Parking is also another aspect of the game that I find a unique way to score, and to end the match. 

= Anders
After watching the game reveal for the Vex Robotics 2025-2026 season, I noticed that it has quite a few interesting and unique mechanics. First off, the shape of the blocks is deceptively simple. Although at first they look like simple cubes, their edges are beveled, which makes gripping onto them tricky. I think that teams will also need to prioritize different ways to score, since there are many options available. Retractable/extendable subsystems might be useful, since the overall robot footprint could be decreased for end-game parking. I also think that descoring and speed will be very valuable to almost every team, since the scoring blocks are small and look like they could be pushed easily. Finally, the lack of a possession limit means that hoarding all the blocks could be an option, however I think the sheer number of them (88 total, 44 for each alliance) makes this unlikely.
